Depression is a serious diagnosis that requires medical intervention and treatment, often with medication. However, many people use the word "depression" to describe a temporary low mood, lack of motivation, or melancholy that can occur during certain periods of life. This condition may indeed be temporary, but it is important to understand that this is not clinical depression. People often confuse these concepts, calling their temporary condition "depression", although in fact it is simply a reaction to stress or fatigue.

Clinical depression is a serious illness, for which a person may even be given a sick leave, since this condition requires professional treatment. And what many call "depression" in everyday life is rather a temporary deterioration in mood that can last for several days.

How to cope with such a condition if it is not clinical depression, but just a temporary decline? Neurocoach Yulia Elskaya offers 7 rules that will help restore harmony and energy. These guidelines are aimed at helping people cope with temporary mood swings, not with true depression that requires medical attention.

## 1. Maintaining discipline and restoring daily routine

One of the most important factors influencing our condition is the body's biorhythms. Yulia Elskaya emphasizes the importance of restoring the daily routine. Disruption of circadian rhythms is the main cause of low energy and bad mood. It is important to go to bed no later than 10:00 PM and wake up around 5:30 AM. This is the time when our hormonal system is activated, which promotes the production of happiness hormones such as serotonin and endorphin. A proper sleep schedule is not just rest, but a way to maintain inner harmony and stability.

Getting up early promotes the production of serotonin, the hormone of happiness. After 6 AM, its level increases, which creates a feeling of fullness and joy. In addition to serotonin, dopamine, endorphin and oxytocin play an important role.

* Dopamine is responsible for the feeling of joy when you find something important or a new idea comes to you.

* Endorphin softens pain and creates a feeling of lightness.

* Serotonin is associated with a feeling of recognition and respect from others.

* Oxytocin gives a feeling of security and trust in the circle of close people.

* To maintain the balance of these hormones, it is important to observe the sleep and wakefulness regime.

## 2. Physical activity

Exercise is not only a way to keep your body in shape, but also a powerful tool for improving your emotional state. During exercise, endorphins are released, which help cope with stress and improve your mood. Even a short walk in the fresh air can be the first step towards overcoming depression.

When a person is depressed, they often lose the desire to move. However, physical activity, even in small doses, helps restore hormonal balance. Yulia Yelskaya advises starting small - for example, doing 10 squats a day. This approach helps to gradually increase activity and return energy to the body. Even small physical exercises help improve mood, relieve stress and improve the overall condition of the body.

Hormonal balance is directly dependent on nutrition. Include foods rich in tryptophan (a precursor to serotonin), such as bananas, nuts, cheese and eggs, in your diet. Avoid excess sugar and caffeine, which can cause sudden mood swings.

## 3. Full rest

Don't confuse a full-fledged rest with just "lazing around" on the couch. Real rest for the brain and body is procedures that allow you to "switch off" from everyday worries. Special spa procedures, massages or meditations will help relax the body and clear your thoughts. Yulia Yelskaya emphasizes that the brain does not rest even during sleep, so it is important to pay attention to deep relaxation, which will help restore energy balance.

## 4. Doing what you love

Creative activity is an important component of overcoming depression.

By favorite activity, Yulia Yelskaya means not just a hobby, but an activity that brings joy and satisfaction. This could be drawing, singing, dancing or creating something with your own hands. It is important to find exactly the activity that gives a boost of energy and allows you to distract yourself from negative thoughts.

## 5. Contrast shower

A contrast shower is one of the simple and affordable ways to improve blood circulation, increase endorphin levels and reduce stress. It not only activates the body, but also helps improve the quality of sleep. Yulia Yelskaya recommends taking a contrast shower both in the morning and in the evening. It is also important to observe other conditions for quality sleep: sleep in a dark room with fresh air and not too high a temperature.

## 6. Herbal teas and aromatherapy

Natural remedies such as aromatherapy and herbal teas help combat depression by influencing our limbic system, which is responsible for emotions and behavior. Aromas such as lavender, lemon balm, or sage promote relaxation, while herbal teas help normalize the nervous system. These simple methods help improve emotional well-being and increase energy levels.

## 7. New impressions

One of the most powerful methods of fighting depression is to gain new impressions. Yulia Yelskaya advises making a list of places you want to visit and choosing something new at least once a week. This could be an exhibition, a museum, a new park, or even a trip to a neighboring city. New impressions are a way to bring back the joy of life, increase the level of happiness hormones, and become more open to the world.

Getting out of depression is not a one-time action, but a complex process that includes restoring discipline, physical activity, rest, hobbies, proper care of the body and brain, as well as regularly updating impressions.
