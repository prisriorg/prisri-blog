**Chronic lack of sleep is a fairly common problem for many people. Especially workaholics. It also happens that a drowsy state literally haunts a person. A specialist explained the reasons for daytime sleepiness: it is caused by a lack of night sleep, brain damage or neurological problems.**

## Other causes include :

* **poor sleep hygiene** - falling asleep in front of the TV or laptop, for example. The brain does not have time to process the information and tune in to the deep sleep phase.

* **chronic fatigue syndrome** - a person is exhausted or stressed.

* **improper diet** - after consuming a large amount of sugar, the blood is saturated with glucose. After this, a person feels a short-lived surge of energy, which is replaced by drowsiness.

## You can combat daytime sleepiness in the following ways :

- go to bed and wake up at the same fixed time;

- go for morning walks;

- do not drink alcohol and caffeine before bed;

- have dinner 3-4 hours before going to bed;

-  exercise regularly.
