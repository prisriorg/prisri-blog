**Sleeping on your stomach, which is so popular among many, can lead to displacement of the vertebrae, and subsequently to back pain.**

When sleeping on your stomach, especially with your knees pulled up to your chest, deep breathing becomes difficult and your lower back twists, which leads to a shift in the vertebrae, the doctor explained. " Over time, this will cause back pain, nerve compression, or stiffness ."

In addition, sleeping on your stomach is harmful because your head is turned to the side for several hours. In this position, your neck is overstrained, which increases the pressure on your spine, the doctor said.

The best sleeping position is on your back. With it, your entire body is in the most neutral position possible, so the health risk is reduced to zero. In addition, those who sleep on their backs have fewer wrinkles, the nephrologist noted.
