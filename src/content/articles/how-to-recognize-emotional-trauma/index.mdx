**Have you ever had an experience that left a deep mark on your soul? Do the memories of it still cause pain? If so, you may be dealing with an emotional wound.**

It is a psychological trauma that can negatively affect your physical and mental health. Such wounds arise from disappointments, betrayals, emotional abuse, and other difficult events. Here are seven signs that you may be emotionally wounded.

## 1. **Intrusive memories**

After an emotional trauma, a person may experience flashbacks. Memories are divided into two types:

Explicit - when a person consciously replays a traumatic event in his or her head.

Hidden - manifest as unexpected emotional reactions that are difficult to explain.

## 2. **Low self-esteem**

Traumatic events can make you doubt yourself. According to psychotherapist Tracy Hutchinson, verbal abuse and humiliation often cause emotional wounds. This leads to feelings of worthlessness and shame. However, with the right approach, you can restore your self-confidence.

## 3. **Difficulty controlling emotions**

Frequent irritability, angry outbursts, or tearfulness may be signs of emotional trauma. Psychologist Melanie Greenberg notes that such traumas can affect the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which are responsible for emotional regulation.

## 4. **Emotional eating**

If you often reach for food when you are stressed, it may be a way to cope with internal pain. The fact is that food stimulates the production of dopamine, the pleasure hormone. However, the habit of “eating” stress can lead to weight problems and eating disorders.

## 5. **Sleep disorders**

If you have trouble falling asleep, waking up frequently, or, on the contrary, excessive sleepiness, this may be due to trauma. Fears, anxiety, and adrenaline can prevent you from relaxing.

## 6. **Feelings of sadness and emptiness**

Do you feel sad for no apparent reason? Do you sometimes have bouts of crying? Long-term emotional pain can lead to either severe depression or complete emotional numbness.

## 7. **Isolation and mistrust**

If you avoid socializing and feel more comfortable alone than around people, your emotional wound may be preventing you from opening up to the world. However, prolonged isolation can make your emotional state worse.
