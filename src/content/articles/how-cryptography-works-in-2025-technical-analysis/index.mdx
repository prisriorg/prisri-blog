## **What is Cryptography?**

Cryptography is the science of securing information and communications through mathematical techniques. It ensures **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **authenticity**, and **non-repudiation** of data. 

### Key Cryptographic Goals:
1. **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorized access to information.
2. **Integrity:** Ensure data is not altered during transmission.
3. **Authenticity:** Verify the identity of communicating parties.
4. **Non-repudiation:** Prevent denial of actions or communications.

## **Core Components of Cryptography**

Cryptography in 2025 relies on several foundational concepts:

### **1. Encryption Algorithms**
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses a single key for encryption and decryption. Algorithms like **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** remain industry standards.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Employs a key pair (public and private keys). Widely used algorithms include **RSA** and **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**.

### **2. Hashing**
Hash functions convert data into fixed-size strings, ensuring data integrity. Popular algorithms include **SHA-3** and **BLAKE3**.

### **3. Digital Signatures**
Digital signatures validate data authenticity and integrity. They combine cryptographic hash functions and asymmetric encryption.

### **4. Key Management**
Managing cryptographic keys is critical for secure communication. Innovations in hardware security modules (HSMs) and cloud-based key management systems are revolutionizing this process.
