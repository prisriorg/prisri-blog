In 2024, Russians received 27.6 thousand invitations to work in China. The year before last, there were almost six times fewer such invitations - 4.8 thousand.

RBC writes about this with reference to the research of the job search service HH. It takes into account only the region of the vacancy for which the specialist was invited. That is, the company itself could be either foreign or Russian.

Last year, the demand for Russian specialists in Serbia also increased significantly: they received 26.3 thousand invitations to work in this country, 4.5 times more than in 2023. Companies from Turkey began inviting Russian employees to work almost three times more often: in 2023, there were 23.5 thousand invitations to work there, and in 2024 - 67.8 thousand.

There was also a significant increase in activity from Cyprus, which sent 12 thousand invitations to Russians against 4.6 thousand in 2023, Poland - 9 thousand invitations against 4.1 thousand, the UAE - 41.7 thousand invitations against 19.2 thousand.

At the same time, demand for specialists from Russia fell in Azerbaijan: companies operating there sent 8.6 thousand invitations to Russians, while in 2023 there were 13.8 thousand. A similar trend is observed in Armenia, where the volume of invitations decreased by 24%, from 13.3 to 10.1 thousand, Georgia - a drop from 87.3 to 69.7 thousand and Kazakhstan - a drop from 169.5 to 150.9 thousand.

## Law on the digital ruble: when will digital money be introduced in Russia

On July 24, 2023, the president signed the law on the digital ruble. It allowed the introduction of a new form of money in Russia.

Digital rubles will now be added to cash and non-cash ones. Moreover, Russians will be able to use them as early as 2025.

We tell you everything you need to know about the digital ruble: whether you can open a deposit or get a loan, what the fees will be, and when the digital ruble will become available to residents of the Russian Federation.

How the digital ruble will work and what it is
The digital ruble is a digital currency of the central bank, a full-fledged analogue of the cash ruble and the ruble on an electronic account. We have written a large article about what it is technically, how it differs from cryptocurrency and how payments with digital rubles will be arranged, which we update periodically.

With the adoption of the law, the digital ruble appeared in the Russian legal field: its status was defined, the relationship between the operator, participants and users of the platform was spelled out.

## Digital ruble: what is it

How the digital ruble works. In short, the digital ruble is a unique digital code that is stored in an electronic wallet on a special platform of the Central Bank. It is the Central Bank that will issue it, just as it currently issues cash into circulation. That is, the digital ruble will be backed by the reserves and assets of the state, and this is one of its main differences from cryptocurrencies, with which digital money is often compared.

At the same time, for the average user, the new form of money will not differ much from the usual non-cash. Digital rubles can also be used to pay in stores or transfer them from one account to another. The Central Bank promises that digital rubles can be used to pay without an Internet connection, although this option has not yet been worked out.

The main difference between digital rubles and non-cash is that they will have their own markings, which makes the new money look like cash. Similar to how ruble banknotes are numbered, digital rubles will have their own unique code.

Who will be the operator of the digital ruble? The adopted law secures the status of the operator of the digital ruble platform for the Bank of Russia. That is, the Central Bank will not only issue digital money, but also be responsible for its safety and accounting of transactions. And also - to ensure the functioning of the digital ruble platform, which it itself developed.

Back in mid-2023, the regulator announced the readiness of the main version of the digital ruble platform. It will be where all digital wallets of Russians and other users of the new form of money will be stored. This is another important difference from non-cash rubles, which are kept in accounts in commercial banks.

At the same time, banks will also be involved in operations with the digital ruble. The law gives them the status of financial intermediaries between the Central Bank and ordinary users.

What will be the tariffs? The Central Bank will set uniform tariffs for all users of the digital ruble. That is, unlike the current situation with non-cash payments, when each bank itself determines what commission to introduce for a particular transaction, in digital rubles everything will be decided monopolistically by a single platform operator - the Bank of Russia.

He has already decided that transfers in the digital ruble will be free for citizens, and for legal entities the commission will be 15 rubles per transaction.

Tariffs for businesses for accepting payments in digital rubles will be 0.3% of the payment. This is several times lower than the current commissions for bank acquiring. For companies providing housing and communal services, the tariff will be symbolic - 0.2%, but no more than 10 ₽.

These rates will come into effect in 2026, and until then, any transactions with digital rubles on the Bank of Russia platform will be free.

Moreover, tariffs may change in the future; this possibility is also stipulated in the law.

Where the digital ruble can be used
With digital money, you can do almost everything that you can with regular money - pay, transfer, accept payments. Moreover, digital rubles can be freely transferred to non-cash and back. After transferring to non-cash, rubles can be withdrawn as cash, as is done now.

But the circulation of digital rubles will also have some peculiarities.

There will be no interest income. It will not be possible to open a deposit or get a loan in digital rubles. It will also not be possible to receive interest on the balance or cashback for purchases.

Thus, it is difficult to consider the digital ruble as a means of saving money. If you keep large amounts in digital wallets, they will gradually be devalued by inflation.

Also, a number of other operations and instruments will not be available in digital rubles. For example, it will not be possible to open a metal account.

One client — one wallet. Now you can open many accounts in different banks and even open several in one bank. A person can have only one account with digital rubles and only on the Central Bank platform.

You can open and close it using your usual banking services. There will be no commission for replenishing the account.

Access to the wallet is through banking applications. Russians will use digital rubles through mobile applications of commercial banks and their Internet banking. For this, credit institutions will connect to the new platform of the Central Bank.

To pay for goods or services, you will need to scan the QR code at the checkout. And to transfer money to another person, send money by phone number, as we do now through the Fast Payment System. The Central Bank promises that in the future it will be possible to pay with digital rubles using contactless NFC technology.

So far, the project's pilot group includes 15 banks that are participating in testing the digital ruble. As the digital ruble is introduced, other financial institutions will be connected to the platform.

The digital ruble is protected by banking secrecy. Banks participating in the platform cannot disclose information about transactions of digital ruble users. That is, the new form of money is subject to the same requirements for protecting banking secrecy as cash and non-cash transactions.

There are exceptions to these rules. For example, according to the law on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, a bank is obliged to provide authorized bodies with information about the movement of funds in an account. Given that payments in digital rubles will leave a more pronounced digital trace, it should become easier for the authorities to combat illegal machinations.

Also, the Central Bank does not have the right to establish any restrictions on types of transactions outside the framework of federal laws or digital ruble account agreements.

When will the digital ruble appear?
The Central Bank expects that Russians will be able to start using the digital ruble en masse from July 1, 2025. By that time, the largest banks should adapt their systems and provide clients with the opportunity to open digital wallets and conduct transactions with digital rubles. In the meantime, they are being tested.

The banks tested the first operations on the test platform back in early 2022. Some banks have already developed special versions of the mobile application adapted for the use of digital rubles.

Test operations involving real clients were supposed to begin in April 2023, but  were postponed due to delays in the adoption of the law. The law on the digital ruble came into force on August 1, 2023, and  then, in August, banks began testing with clients.

In parallel with the technical testing, the regulator also finalized the regulatory framework. In July 2023, it presented the rules for the operation of the digital ruble platform. They describe, for example, how users will open and close digital wallets, what operations will be available to them, and how their claims will be handled.

Separately, the Central Bank emphasizes that the use of digital money will be voluntary. As now, people will be able to independently choose the form of money that is convenient for them: cash, non-cash or digital.
