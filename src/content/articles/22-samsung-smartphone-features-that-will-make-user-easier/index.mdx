Samsung smartphones run a heavily modified version of Android called One UI, which adds more and more features every year.

I've often written reviews of Samsung smartphones and used them for a long time. Most of the branded "features" are not very practical, but I've gotten used to some of them so much that it's uncomfortable to use other devices without them.

In this article, I highlighted the most useful and interesting features that may be useful to owners of Samsung smartphones. The text is based on my experience with  the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy A72. I also studied official materials and reviews from users and  fellow reviewers.

Currently, the current version is considered to be One UI 6. To check whether your phone supports this system, you can check the list on the Samsung community website. Not all models from previous years have received an update to this version, so for each function in the article, the oldest supported firmware version is indicated.

Common functions
Edge Sidebar
What it is: A menu for quickly accessing apps and tools on any screen
Where it's available: On devices with One UI 2.0 and above

How to enable and use. The Edge side menu can be accessed by swiping from the left or right edge of the screen. This is useful for quickly opening a calendar or calculator, calling a loved one, taking a screenshot, or running a couple of apps in split-screen mode.

If the panel does not open, you can activate it like this:

Find the "Display" item in the settings.
Scroll down to "Edge panel".
Select panel type - up to 10 pieces.
The marker's location, color, size, and transparency can be configured in the "Marker" section.

## Samsung Galaxy S23: Review of a Compact Flagship with a Good Camera

Samsung has a Galaxy Store, its own app store. In addition to the eight main panels, you can download more than 50 additional ones, some of which are paid. Here are the panels:

Applications: You can select up to 22 shortcuts for quick access to programs;
People: up to 22 contacts for quick calling;
screenshots: copy a rectangular or arbitrary part of the screen, make a long screenshot or animated gif;
quick actions: add an event to the calendar, take a quick screenshot, launch the camera, create a new contact, add an alarm, write a message;
tools: interactive compass and ruler;
reminders: create a new reminder and open the list;
clipboard: it stores up to 40 of the latest screenshots and recordings. The buffer is cleared automatically over time or by pressing a button;

Common functions
Gestures instead of touch buttons
What it is: Gestures that replace touch controls
Where it's available: On devices with One UI 1.0 and above

How to enable and use. By default, Samsung smartphones show three buttons at the bottom of the screen: Back, Home, and Recents — these are where recently launched apps are displayed. To save space, you can replace them with gestures. Here's how to enable them:

Find the "Display" item in the settings.
Scroll down to "Navigation Bar".
Select the type "Swipe gestures".
Open "Other options".
Choose the type of swipes that is most convenient for you.
If you have previously used an iPhone or other Android smartphones with gesture support, select "Swipe from the bottom edge of the screen and side edges." In this case, the list of open applications will be called up by swiping and holding from the bottom of the screen, exit to the desktop - swipe from the bottom without holding, go back - swipe to the side from the left or right edge of the display.

If you're used to buttons but want to try gestures, choose "Swipe from bottom of screen." On some phones, this scheme is hidden behind the "More options" button. Here, the three buttons remain in  the same places at the bottom of the screen, but instead of being pressed, they are activated by swiping from the bottom edge.

Swipes from the bottom and sides are convenient to use on larger phones that are harder to hold with one hand.

Common functions
Alternative gestures with One Hand Operation+
What it is: An alternative set of gestures for easier one-handed use of the phone
Where it is available: On devices with One UI 1.0 and above

How to enable and use. If the two pre-installed gesture control schemes are not convenient enough, you can download the official One Hand Operation+ program . It allows you to perform many actions with one finger, without grabbing the phone at all.

Several markers can be placed on the side edges, each with available settings for the appearance and set of functions. There are 50 functions in total, some with additional options. I will not list them all, but in addition to the standard ones, there are also unusual ones:

switching tracks and volume;
opening the notification panel;
quick closing of applications;
fast sending of links;
start split screen or move the program to a small window;
Record video from the screen.
In the marker settings, you can select the number of functions and angles for each swipe

Common functions
Split screen and window mode
What it is: Run multiple apps on one screen
Where it's available: On devices with One UI 1.0 and above

How to enable and use. Programs in windows are convenient to use, for example, to keep an important chat on top of a video or a calculator on top of a banking application. The window size can be adjusted, but on smartphones with small screens this function is inconvenient: the window is still too big.

The mode is initially enabled in the system and is activated through the menu of running applications:

Bring up the menu of open applications.
Click on the icon of the desired application at the top of the screen.
Select "Open in pop-up mode".
Windowed mode on the Galaxy Fold3 screen - the browser does not adjust well to the window, but messengers and YouTube are convenient to use
Windowed mode on the Galaxy Fold3 screen - the browser does not adjust well to the window, but messengers and YouTube are convenient to use
In addition to applications in windows, there is a split-screen mode. In it, the display is divided into two parts, with one program in each. On folding smartphones of the Z Fold series, the screen is divided into three parts.

This will come in handy when working with documents and letters, when you need to keep a translator or a page with information in front of your eyes. For some applications, you can choose the window size - from half to  1/5 of the display. For example, you can open a training video on YouTube on a quarter of the screen and simultaneously take notes in a notebook .

## How to Properly Care for Your Smartphone: 5 Tips to Extend the Life of Your Device

You can open a pair of applications in the same way as a window, via the recently launched menu. But you need to select "Run in split screen mode".

The second way to open a pair of apps is through the Edge sidebar:

Open the sidebar with applications.
Press and hold the first app icon and drag it to the top or bottom of the screen.
Select an application for the free half of the screen.
To split the screen into three sections on Galaxy Fold:

Open the first two applications in a convenient way.
Open the Edge sidebar and drag the icon of the desired program to the chosen location on the left or right side of the screen.
If you drag the icon to the center of the screen, nothing will happen.
You can pin two-app split-screen sets to the Edge panel or the desktop. The phone will create a dual icon to quickly access, for example, a browser and a note-taking app. Here's how to pin a combination of apps:

Open the apps you want in split screen mode.
Click on the three dots between the two apps.
Click on the star.
Choose where you want to add it - to your desktop or Edge screen.
Three dots on the separator line open a menu where you can swap open applications or add a bundle to your favorites

Common functions
DeX mode
What it is: A mode in which the phone can be connected to a monitor like a desktop PC
Where it is available: On Galaxy Note 8 and newer smartphones and Galaxy Tab S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8 tablets

How to turn on and use. Simply connect your phone to the display via  USB-C via the docking station.

In this mode, the phone broadcasts a “full-fledged” desktop onto the screen, like a desktop PC: with a “Start” panel and the ability to open programs in separate windows or on the entire screen.

A wired connection is available for any monitor or TV with HDMI. You will need to purchase a docking station from Samsung or a third-party manufacturer - these are sold, for example, on Aliexpress .The main thing is that it is possible to connect additional power to the adapter via  USB-C.The phone's built-in battery is not powerful enough in this mode. USB ports will also come in handy - to connect an external keyboard and mouse.

The same thing is available wirelessly, but you'll need a 2019 or newer Samsung smart TV . If your TV is compatible, here's what you need to do:

Connect your TV and phone to the same Wi-Fi network.
Open the quick settings panel on your smartphone by swiping down and tapping on the DeX icon.
Select "DeX for TV or Monitor".
If you only see "DeX for PC", click the three vertical dots. This will open the "More" menu, and select "Switch to  TV/monitor".
Select the desired display from the list and click "Start".
Confirm the connection.
For control, you can use the touchpad on the phone screen or connect a mouse and keyboard via Bluetooth.
The Dex for PC mode is activated by connecting a compatible phone to a Windows PC. All you need is a regular USB-C cable included in the package.

The smartphone desktop opens in a window - this is convenient if you need to work on someone else's computer, but do not want to log into your mail and social networks. This is also an option for old laptops, on which the browser and social networks work slower than on the connected phone.

How to enable and use. This feature appeared in 2023 with the flagship Galaxy S23 line. It works roughly like iOS 16: you can change the style and content of the lock screen to your taste. For example, choose one of the clock options that will “fit” into the background image. Or even set a short video instead of wallpaper.

There are no full-fledged widgets on the locked screen, like on the iPhone, but you can select any two applications or contacts for quick access. The icons will appear in the lower left and lower right corners.

Open the Phone app.
Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.
