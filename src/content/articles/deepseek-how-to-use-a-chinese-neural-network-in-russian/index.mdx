DeepSeek is a neural network that caused chaos on the world market with its appearance: it brought down the shares of high-tech companies and called into question the leadership of ChatGPT. Let's see what this AI model is and how to use it for free in Russian.
## DeepSeek – what is this neural network?
DeepSeek is an AI model from a Chinese company of the same name. Until January 2025, few people in Russia had heard of it, which is why its success seems fantastic to many users. 

But let's be realistic: of course, this neural network was not created by amateurs, not in the evenings and not in 5 minutes. The world first heard about DeepSeek in 2023 - the announcement of the project's release was made by a team of engineers from the High-Flyer company. And the "miracles" began later. 

A year later, the developers rolled out the second version - DeepSeek-V2, in December 2024 - the third, DeepSeek-V3. And in January 2025 - two editions at once - DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Moreover, the latest versions of the neural network are not inferior in quality to GPT-4o. That's where the miracle is :) 


**What DeepSeek can do:**

1. Respond to requests in text and voice format. 
2. Maintain dialogue.
3. Analyze files. 
4. Generate text.


## How to work with DeepSeek
**Option 1**. Through the (official website)[https://www.deepseek.com/]. Free, with registration. You can log in using your Google account. The interface is in English, but it understands Russian prompts well. As an example, I asked the neural network to write a funny poem about artificial intelligence.

**Option 2**. In the mobile app. On the website, in the lower left corner of the screen, there is a button called “Get App”. If you hover over it, a QR code will appear to take you to the store.
The smart AI assistant is available for both iOS and Android. It's also free. The interface is a bit simpler than the website, but it handles the tasks. I asked to analyze the contents of a screenshot of a conversation with a person who wanted to publish a fraudulent vacancy in the Telegram channel of our work project.

**Option 3**. In Telegram. The success of the Chinese AI model did not pass by the owners of neural network aggregator bots. But in fact, the vast majority of them decided to just hype it up: they included DeepSeek in the channel name, but “forgot” to integrate it into their product. For the test, I took 14 bots, but only in one I was able to use DeepSeek without subscriptions and other dances with tambourines. Therefore, for the example below, I took it. 

## Which is better - DeepSeek or ChatGPT
It's hard to say yet. In my editorial opinion, ChatGPT's texts are slightly worse than DeepSeek's, but it all depends on the prompt: if you "conjure" over the request for ChatGPT, the result will also be good. It's good that the Chinese AI model is available without restrictions, it can be used in different ways and it doesn't hit your pocket. What will happen next - time will tell.
