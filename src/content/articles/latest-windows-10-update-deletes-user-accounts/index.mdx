Often, updates of leading operating systems bring unexpected and not always positive changes to the user. The latest Microsoft updates for Windows 10 continued the series of failures that constantly haunt the operating system with literally every update. This time, user accounts began to be deleted during the update.

Windows 10 build number KB4532693 deletes permanent accounts, replacing them with temporary ones. Along the way, users lose files located on the desktop, individual settings are reset, and other problems appear.

What leads to such actions of the system has not yet been clarified, but according to Windows Central experts, the problem can be fixed by multiple restarts. Microsoft acknowledges the existence of the problem and states that they are working to eliminate the consequences of the unsuccessful update.

I installed Win10 Lite Edition with all the junk disabled, like updates, telemetry, metro, defender and other crap. I also installed Classic Shell, since the native interface is very difficult for a normal person to digest!
And a miracle! Nothing glitches! Everything works quickly and nothing annoys! I never even had the desire to tear everything down and install the Seven again, which happened the previous three times I got acquainted with Win10.
Thanks to the person who bothered and shook out all the junk from the distribution and posted it on the Internet!

>  the clumsy rams who have these problems
are divided into two categories:
1. The management of Microsoft, which castrated its professional testers and transferred their work to the "insider program", i.e. ordinary users
2. Windows developers

## Greedy Windows 10 Will Require More Memory for Update
The volumes required to install the Windows 10 operating system are constantly increasing, and users have to constantly monitor the capabilities of their computers to install updates. The new Windows 10 OS update, starting with version 1903, will occupy a uniquely large volume.

The figure will increase to 32 GB. For comparison, this update will require twice as much disk space as needed to install the 32-bit version of Windows 10 version 1809. Also, the new version will be 12 GB more than needed for the 64-bit version of Windows 10.

According to experts, the unstoppable increase in the amount of memory occupied by the operating system may affect the functioning of computers or laptops. However, such innovations are expected. Microsoft reserves more memory for programs, temporary files and service operations. This solution will help eliminate problems similar to those that arose after the updates in October 2018, when user files began to disappear from computers .

Now, by reserving more free space, Microsoft will try to eliminate this class of problems, especially for laptops with small SSDs. At the same time, the update process will also become more convenient, during which you can simply delete outdated temporary files to expand the backup storage.

"updates in October 20918". There is no reason to be surprised by such errors.
Am I the only one who disabled updates and who gives a damn about all these problems associated with them?

I still recommend updating the grammar checker. :)

I don't give a shit about you until you get hacked. I was like that myself.
Nobody needs your personal information, and if YOURSELF downloaded some nasty stuff from unverified sources and, despite your antivirus, launched it, firstly, itâ€™s your own fault, and secondly, the very first rule of storing important information is to store at least one copy somewhere, because your information can be simply erased by the next Windows update, look through the articles on this site, something like this has happened somewhere before.

You are an idealist, but this is due to lack of knowledge and experience.

"Nobody needs your personal info"
Nobody needs my credit card details? :))

"and if YOURSELF downloaded the nasty stuff from unverified sources"
There are plenty of verified sources from which you can pick up all sorts of nasty stuff. For example, Google Market. But there are also vulnerabilities that viruses can use to get into your computer, even if you haven't downloaded anything. Windows updates are needed precisely because of vulnerabilities.

"in spite of your antivirus, you launched it"
Antivirus databases are not updated immediately as new viruses appear, but with a delay. Antiviruses only protect against already widespread and therefore known nasty stuff.

"the very first rule of storing important information"
There was no talk about backup copies, I think.

## Windows 10 update will improve system performance
The official Windows blog has announced the release of the beta version of Windows 10 build 17604. The main innovation for users of the Windows 10 Pro operating system will be the Ultimate Performance for Workstations mode.

Using the maximum performance mode, users will be able to independently disable some secondary tasks. All saved resources can be used to perform key tasks, such as video editing, working with raster images (3D rendering), as well as other important processes that require a lot of power.

Enabling the mode will be available in the control panel in the Power section. However, Microsoft developers warn that this mode may affect the performance of the computer's components. Apparently, this means accelerated wear of parts. In addition, this mode consumes more electricity.

The increased performance feature is available for owners of desktop computers; this mode is not provided for tablets and laptops with "ordinary" Windows 10. The timing of the inclusion of the maximum performance feature in the final version of Windows 10 is not reported.

## Microsoft is moving Windows 10 S into a separate mode for Windows 10
After the presentation of Windows 10 S last year as a more secure and simplified OS designed for educational institutions and budget laptops, many manufacturers released gadgets with the built-in Windows 10 S operating system. These companies include ASUS, HP, Acer and Lenovo. However, now there is information about a change in Microsoft's policy regarding the further distribution of this OS.

Microsoft, apparently, refuses to support the development of Windows 10 S as a separate OS and plans to transfer it to one of the modes of the global Windows 10 called "S Mode". The new configuration will appear in Windows 10 Home, Enterprise and Pro. Moreover, in all versions of the operating system, the mode is activated automatically. Consequently, users will be able to download applications only from one source - the branded Microsoft Store, which, although there are many programs, is far from all, for example, there are no popular browsers.

Free disabling of the "S Mode" is available for Windows 10 Home users, for owners of computers with Windows 10 Pro, disabling the mode will cost $ 49. In addition, Microsoft will radically change the cost of various editions of Windows 10. From now on, the price will depend on the power and cost of the user's computer. Five different categories of devices will be offered and, accordingly, five different prices for licensed Windows 10: Entry ($25), Value ($45), Core ($65.45), Core+ ($86.66) and Advanced ($101). Prices will come into effect on April 2, 2018.
